# Diabetes_Prediction-using-ML
"A machine learning-based system to predict diabetes using medical and demographic features such as age, BMI, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level. Includes data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model training (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest), and evaluation. Random Forest achieved the best performance."
# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project develops a machine learning model to predict diabetes based on medical and demographic features.  
Early prediction can help prevent severe complications such as kidney failure and cardiovascular diseases.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle  
- **Features:** Age, Gender, BMI, Hypertension, Heart Disease, Smoking History, HbA1c Level, Blood Glucose Level  
- **Target:** Diabetes Presence (binary)

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. Data Collection  
2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Feature Selection  
5. Model Building (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)  
6. Model Evaluation  

## 🚀 Key Findings
- Random Forest achieved the best accuracy and F1-score.  
- HbA1c and Blood Glucose are the strongest predictors.  

## 📈 Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

## 🔮 Future Work
- Collecting real-world clinical data  
- Adding lifestyle-related features  
- Deploying as a web application
